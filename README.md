# About Me

Hello! I'm Ashwini Nagar, a passionate student, currently pursuing my Masters in Computer Applications. I'm working on various projects and assignments to enhance and polish my programming skills plus improvising my command over other Technical Skills. Having a keen interest in working with Python, my goal is to master Python and use it to solve real-world challenges.

# Projects

### [1. TO-DO-LIST-APP](https://github.com/nagarashwini31/To-Do-List)
This project is a Python-based To-Do List application designed to help users organize and manage their tasks efficiently. The application allows users to add, view, update, and delete tasks, ensuring an easy way to keep track of daily responsibilities. Using a simple and intuitive command-line interface, it provides a practical solution for task management, making it ideal for users looking to stay productive and organized. The project can be extended to include features like task prioritization, deadlines, and persistence through file storage.

### [2. Snake-Game](https://github.com/nagarashwini31/Snake_Game)
This project is a classic Snake Game built using Python and the Turtle graphics library. The game challenges players to control a snake that grows longer as it consumes food, while avoiding collisions with itself and the game boundaries. It features smooth animations, real-time score tracking, and increasing difficulty as the snake grows. This project is a fun way to learn game development concepts and Python programming, making it perfect for beginners and gaming enthusiasts alike.


### [3. Image Resizer](https://github.com/nagarashwini31/Image-Resizer)
This project is a Python-based tool designed to resize images to specified dimensions. Using the Pillow library, the program takes an input image, resizes it to the desired width and height, and saves the resized image to a specified location. The tool is straightforward, user-friendly, and supports multiple image formats, making it ideal for tasks like preparing images for websites, social media, or other applications where size consistency is essential.  

### [4.GUI-Calculator](https://github.com/nagarashwini31/GUI-Calculator)

A GUI Calculator is a user-friendly application with a graphical interface for performing basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). Built using Python libraries like tkinter or PyQt, it features buttons for digits, operations, and clear/reset functions. It displays input and results in a text box, mimicking a physical calculator.
